## *Awakening at Dawn*

*Night lifts to misty dawn slowly,*

*The darkness yielding bit by bit,*

*Each ray of sun expanding bright*

*The once-dim landscape basking numb.*

*Details emerge from veil of black;*

*Colors peek from shadow&rsquo;s sack*

*As eyes adjust to morning&rsquo;s light*

*Now cresting topmost hills in gold.*

<br/>

*So too with law&rsquo;s first hint once hid.*

*We squint to glimpse the forms now shown*

*In dawn&rsquo;s soft glow; what blaze will come*

*When noonday sun reveals the whole?*

*Then darkness fully dies in day,*

*No shapes obscure, no line astray,*

*As full truth burns shadows away &mdash;*

<br/>

*But patience till that final ray!*

<br/>

*Across the hills some still sleep sound,*

*Their eyes not cracked to welcome morn.*

*Below others hail day&rsquo;s new sight,*

*Their vision glimpsing law&rsquo;s first forms.*

*Neither fully right nor reason wrong;*

*Sequences in light to which we throng*

*Must not belittle those whose hour*

*Has yet to wake at wisdom&rsquo;s door.*

<br/>

*Let dawn&rsquo;s first seers walk humble, kind,*

*Nor shout the news to ears still stopped.*

*Drops swell the wave till all eyes find*

*The day, no needed soul left locked*

*In scorn&rsquo;s dark prison of the &ldquo;blind&rdquo; &mdash;*

*Rather with care help souls behind*

*Now rouse and rub their vision clear,*

*That soon all stand in morning’s cheer*

*As one shared beam makes night no more.*

&mdash;

## Moral vagueness comes into focus

The journey of moral awakening follows a similar organic flow in each individual and society, as in a growing plant. All begin as seeds, latent with ethical potential but still rooted in the soil of self-interest and limited in sights. Blind spots feel normal.

Yet in time, through enduring the elements, reaching for light, or encountering foreign nutrients, the seed cracks open. Moments of empathy, courage and hardship act as catalysts nurturing moral shoots. Perspectives broaden, assumptions fall, concern expands circle-by-circle past tribe and race.

As understanding flowers, the plant aligns more fully with the sun’s offered path. Societies too unfold, led by reforming hearts, lifting visions over walls once thought innate and immovable. Slowly, steadily, moral illumination dawns, slavery’s shadows retreat.

No one flower claims superiority over the next. All share the same soil, draw on the same rain and light, contributors to beauty’s mosaic. So too we share a common creator, common core of conscience. Our blossoming unique, its timing undefined, but direction set - towards justice, healing, the truest light.

Our duty then is walking humbly amidst varied growth, neither prideful nor stalled. Lend kindly care. Uphold hope over scorn. Stand in awe alongside ancient oaks still striking skyward and tender buds still kissing dawn. Sacred stories still being written by one ever-unfolding moral hand.
