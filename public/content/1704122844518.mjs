A story from Burning Man.

Thousands of people come together to focus on the light. Literally with the light from the fire of the burn night but also by following the 10 principles.

There's party animals, posers, and musicians, and spiritual seekers. I mostly fall into the latter category. I went with curiousity and an open mind to try to understand the world better.

The first thing you notice is that it completely overwhelms your rational mind. You immediately stop trying to figure it all out and you have to go with the flow. Right now is all that matters, you can't even plan for the future an hour from now, let alone tomorrow. You have no idea where the night will take you.

Those of us that are seekers try to make sense of it, and many end up running across each other on the playa.

Why are humans doing this? What do we get out of it? What can we learn?

One night I was walking alone near my camp. I saw a stranger approaching me on the road, another curious soul riding a bicycle. I heard a voice in my mind, as clear as if someone had spoken it to me, spontaneously that answered all of the above questions I was thinking about that day:

"There are no bad people"

He pulled up closer to me, stopped his bike. He was dusty, with an open shirt and a rugged yet worn bicycle. He smiled. I smiled back at him, a gentle smile of familiarity and knowing between close friends. He laughed and said out loud:

"There are no bad people"

I looked at him and laughed with a knowing laugh. Now I knew what I needed to learn. He knew I knew. I knew that he knew that I knew. We savored the moment for another few seconds, and then without a word, he took his feet off the ground and pedaled off into the night, seeking his next adventure.

I stayed with that for a while. All the death and destruction we cause, and none of us are bad? Jesus forgave those that put him on the cross, saying "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."

Later I would read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who experienced being in prison camps for 8 years and who wrote about his experiences. He had this to say:

<blockquote>“The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained”

― Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago 1918–1956</blockquote>

There are no bad people. If one cell of the heart is still good, fan the flames of that cell. No matter how broken, how ignorant, how outwardly decrepit.

The goodness of the Spirit lives inside every human being.
