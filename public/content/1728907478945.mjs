# Where the Stars are Arcs

### A dream, in the early morning hours of Oct 14th, 2024

I sat in my sparsely appointed ground floor, neutral-beige-colored, upper West Side apartment, and noticed. Looking around, I saw various aspects. I wondered if there was a north-facing window. There was, a small one.

My apartment had windows on 3 sides, then, it seemed, although the north window opened up into a courtyard between the rows of buildings that people called home.

I wandered westward from the window to the northwest corner. I noticed a door, whose hinges were welded steel gate hinges, creating a large gap that could not be closed. In fact, I could squeeze through the gate-door without needing to open it.

I turned the corner, and there I saw the landlord, in the courtyard. We spoke briefly, and he let me know he was about to leave on an expidition to the Himalayas, and I'd be welcome to join. I agreed to go, and shortly met my traveling companions, a young man and a young woman. We engaged in pleasantries, as we walked westward towards the water's edge.

We piled into a waiting rowboat, pointed at both ends, and without a word, the landlord picked up oars lying camouflaged on the floor of the boat.

We rowed westward, down the stream, across the river and through the sky.

Turning a bend in the stream, we arrived at the top of a Himalayan plateau. There was lush greenery, whether indoor or outdoor, I could not tell. Through the trees, I could observe the vast expanse of snow-capped peaks, gleaming in the evening sun. We had arrived, and night was quickly falling. The landlord docked the boat, and we stepped off. Dozens of people milled about, going from one place to another at camp. There were 3 wooden cabins on the far side of the river. It seemed as if we were at the origin of the river, so that it was possible to reach the cabins by a 5-minute walk around the source of the river. It was now twilight, and darkness fell quickly, in minutes, across the landscape.

Suddenly I looked up at the sky. All of the stars in the sky were arcs of light - instead of points, sweeping across the sky a finger's width across, seemingly as if an hour of time was always passing concurrently - like looking at a long-exposure photograph of the sky, but in real time.

I looked to the landlord, motioning at the spectacle in the stars. He explained that here, the stars are arcs, as time is passing in a different fashion than back on the ground. I was struck with awe by the phenomenon.

The landlord addressed us all at once: saying that in 9 days he would be here to return us home, and telling us to enjoy our stay. My traveling companions and the landlord vanished into the night, and I was left alone.

I wandered down the north edge of the river, past the cabins, and found a small congregation of people. There might have been a fire. I turned and saw a blind man sitting on a bench, and his sighted female companion standing right behind him, watching the fire over his head, and doting on him. Knowing he was safe, I sat on his lap as there was no bench space available. They laughed at the interaction and rubbed my back and shoulders caringly. We talked for what seemed like tens of minutes, but could have been an hour or so.

Suddenly, I noticed a woman I recognized approaching from the south, "M", an acquaintance from long ago in the city, was walking over. I stood up and stepped closer to her and we embraced joyfully with a gentle squeeze. I wasn't ready for the embrace to end, but she pulled away after a moment. Nevertheless, there was much warmth shared in the meeting of old faces, seeing eye to eye, and heart to heart.

The conversation around the fire continued, with people coming and going, and in 3D life, morning was here, and I woke up.
