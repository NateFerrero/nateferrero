  <h1>End Cruelty in the United States</h1>
  <p>by Nate Ferrero</p>
 </section>
 <h3>People of the United States, I invite you to awaken to the life-breath-force of Christ within you, and use that
  force
  to mitigate the pervasive cruelty of life in the United States.</h3>

  <h2>Every Thing Is Sacred</h2>
  <p>To be Christian is to see Christ in every thing. The book "The Universal Christ" by Richard Rohr reminds us that
   the spirit of Christ is alive in all living flesh.</p>
  <blockquote>
   I saw ... the reverence that everyone must have for a sinner; instead of condoning [their] sin, which in reality is
   [their] utmost sorrow, one must comfort Christ who is suffering in [them]. And this reverence must be paid even to
   the those sinners whose souls seem to be dead, because it is Christ, who is the life of the soul, who is dead in
   them; they are His tombs, and Christ in the tomb [has the potential to become] the risen Christ. . . . Christ is
   everywhere; in Him every kind of life has a meaning and has an influence on every other kind of life.
   &mdash; Caryll Houselander, <i>A Rocking-Horse Catholic</i>

  <h2>End Circumcision Now</h2>
  <p>Circumcision (male genital mutilation) destroys living human cells, nerves, and decreases the sensitivity of the
   male to his own energy, leading to social dysfunction. Female genital mutilation is an equally grave evil.</p>

   States.
