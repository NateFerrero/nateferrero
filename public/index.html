  <h1>End Cruelty in the United States</h1>
  <p>by Nate Ferrero</p>
 </section>
 <h3>People of the United States, I invite you to awaken to the life-breath-force of Christ within you, and direct the
  force within you
  to mitigate the pervasive cruelty of life in the United States.
  <hr />What may seem insurmountable is possible by activating the spirit of Christ within human beings. We must come
  together and communicate with each
  other with clarity and purpose, to enrich our world with love as 'Truth in Word and Action' and release the binding of
  the forces of evil on human flesh.
 </h3>

  <h3>Snapshot of cruelty against human life in the United States</h3>
  <p>
   In January 2020, there were 580,466 people experiencing homelessness on our streets and in shelters

   It is estimated that between 15,000 to 50,000 women and children are forced into sexual slavery in the United States
   every year. One study from the Department of Health and Human Services estimated the number between 240,000 and
   325,000, while a report from the University of Pennsylvania put it at between 100,000 and 300,000.

  <p>Our nation incarcerates more than 1.2 million people in state and federal prisons, and two out of three of these
   incarcerated people are also workers. In most instances, the jobs these nearly 800,000 incarcerated workers have look
   similar to those of millions of people working on the outside. But there are two crucial differences: Incarcerated
   workers are under the complete control of their employers, and they have been stripped of even the most minimal
   protections against labor exploitation and abuse.

   Over 33.8 million Americans (10.4%) lived in households that struggled against food insecurity, or lack of access to
   an affordable, nutritious diet.

 <h1>We can and must unite as a nation to solve these problems</h1>
 <h3>By awakening the Christ within us, we can drastically reduce all forms of human suffering</h3>

  <h2>Every Thing Is Sacred</h2>
  <p>To be Christian is to see Christ in every thing. The book "The Universal Christ" by Richard Rohr reminds us that
   the spirit of Christ is alive in all living flesh.</p>
  <blockquote>
   I saw ... the reverence that everyone must have for a sinner; instead of condoning [their] sin, which in reality is
   [their] utmost sorrow, one must comfort Christ who is suffering in [them]. And this reverence must be paid even to
   the those sinners whose souls seem to be dead, because it is Christ, who is the life of the soul, who is dead in
   them; they are His tombs, and Christ in the tomb [has the potential to become] the risen Christ. . . . Christ is
   everywhere; in Him every kind of life has a meaning and has an influence on every other kind of life.
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash; Caryll Houselander, <i>A Rocking-Horse Catholic</i></p>

   early disciples of Christ knew, and why the good news of the gospel is just as important now as it ever was.</p>

  <h2>Physical touch between men is body-knowledge and communicates the Spirit of Christ with clarity and certainty</h2>
  <p>Men of the United States, I implore you to wake up to the universal spirit of brotherhood through non-sexual
   physical touch. If a man will not touch another man, he
   is in spiritual bankruptcy.</p>
  <p>If you do not know how to touch other men for purpose of communicating the spirit of Christ, start with a light
   hand-to-hand touch and then push on each others shoulders and chests. This awakens the correct 'Gnostic' spirit of
   Christ in male-bodied individuals.</p>
  <p>In order to achieve our highest potential as a human species, men should not sexually interact with women, except
   in the container of a committed Christ-centered
   relationship for the purpose of creating new human life.</p>

  <h2>Women, re-awaken yourselves to the truth of your healing powers</h2>

  <h2>Apply no violence and beware of shedding blood</h2>
  <blockquote>The human body and the soul, which is from God and lives in the human body, are the house of God, the
   temple of the
   Holy Spirit. Deep in the soul is God's love, wisdom, and justice. Thus, God dwells in the soul. Accordingly, the soul
   and body of the human being are the temple of God. And so, the one who breaks into the house of flesh and bone, by
   doing violence to people, by subjugating them, by treating them as slaves, or even killing them, sins against the
   Holy Spirit. ... So keep your hands pure and your soul pure, not just from theft and robbery. But above all, do not
   use violence, be it on people on animals, and beware of shedding their blood.</blockquote>

  <h2>End Circumcision Now</h2>
  <p>Circumcision (male genital mutilation) destroys living human cells, nerves, and decreases the sensitivity of the
   male to his own energy, leading to social dysfunction. Female genital mutilation is an equally grave evil.</p>
