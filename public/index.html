  <h1>The possibility of new life</h1>
  <p>The world of man has gone far into degeneracy, war, abuse of the name of Jesus (i.e. war and murder in the name of
   Jesus, forced conversion to 'Christianity' under threat of death).</p>
  <p>It is time to wake up to basic, universal truths that are available to us all, in order to create a world based on
   peace, kindness, and respect for life.</p>
  <p>I am going to use religious terminology to describe basic realities, but you can substitute non-religious
   terminology for the same words if it helps you connect with the material.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>How to transcend our limited human perspective</h3>
  <p>This material was inspired by reflecting on the book 'The Life of the Mind', by Hannah Arendt, in which she
   explores the
   problem of evil after totalitarian Germany, and postulates that evil in our world is a direct result of lack of
   contemplation. The absense of proper reflection leads to all forms of evil. In this, I will assume that she is
   correct, and explore the possibility of a better world through human contemplation. What is written here is offered
   for your contemplation.</p>

  <h3>End Cruelty in the United States</h3>
  <p>People of the United States, I invite you to awaken to the life-breath-force of Christ within you, and direct the
   force within you
   to mitigate the pervasive cruelty of life in the United States.
   <hr />What may seem insurmountable is possible by activating the spirit of Christ within human beings. We must come
   together and communicate with each
   other with clarity and purpose, to enrich our world with love as 'Truth in Word and Action' and release the binding
   of
   the forces of evil on human flesh.
  </p>
  <h3>By awakening the Christ within us, we can drastically reduce all forms of human suffering.</h3>

   In January 2020, there were 580,466 people experiencing homelessness on our streets and in shelters

   It is estimated that between 15,000 to 50,000 women and children are forced into sexual slavery in the United
   States
   every year. One study from the Department of Health and Human Services estimated the number between 240,000 and
   325,000, while a report from the University of Pennsylvania put it at between 100,000 and 300,000.

  <p>Our nation incarcerates more than 1.2 million people in state and federal prisons, and two out of three of these
   incarcerated people are also workers. In most instances, the jobs these nearly 800,000 incarcerated workers have
   look
   similar to those of millions of people working on the outside. But there are two crucial differences: Incarcerated
   workers are under the complete control of their employers, and they have been stripped of even the most minimal
   protections against labor exploitation and abuse.

   Infant death associated with circumcision. Over 10 years, 200 early deaths were recorded among 9,833,110 subjects (1
   death per 49,166 circumcisions).
   Other sources estimate 100 infants die from circumcision in the United States each year.

  <h3>Guidelines for Christian living as stated in the Bible (New Testament), selected verses (King James Version) and
   my interpretation of each
  </h3>
  <aside>
   <label>Matthew 5:37</label> ... let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these
   cometh of evil
   <hr /><label>Interpretation</label> Making any form of an oath, i.e. signing a legal document, or any other form
   of written promise is of Satan. If you mean yes, say yes, if you mean no, say no. If you're not sure, say you're not
   sure, but don't sign any documents as if you are able to keep promises. Only God can keep promises. It is an
   aberration for human beings to make written promises, and it is delaying the return of Jesus incarnate in the
   biosphere that legal documents are so prevalent in the United States today.</p>
   <hr /><label>How to implement Christ in the flesh</label> Reject any offer to sign a document, remind the person that
   is asking you to sign that oaths belong to God, and are not human property. Do not purchase a car, house, or other
   property if your signature or oath is required to complete the transaction.
  </aside>
  <aside>
   <label>Matthew 10:14</label> ... whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that
   house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.
   <hr /><label>Interpretation</label> Do not spend time with people that are not willing to hear your perspective.
   People that are capable of growth are also willing to listen to honest petitions.
   <hr /><label>How to implement Christ in the flesh</label> Speak up when you witness evil in the workplace, at home,
   in your friendships and family relationships. Anyone who rejects your genuine concerns is not worthy of your
   presence. Leave them immediately and go help those with open ears. The saints of God are hungry for those who will
   speak the truth to them. Feed the hungry, and depart from the self-satiated.
  </aside>
  <aside>
   <label>Matthew 15:11</label> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the
   mouth, this defileth a man.
   <hr /><label>Interpretation</label> The world around you does not define you. The contents of your soul define you.
   Causing destruction, speaking falsehoods, or using foul language corrupt the innermost potential beauty of the human
   soul, and delays the incarnation of Jesus in the biosphere.
   <hr /><label>How to implement Christ in the flesh</label> Watch your mouth, hands, and feet closely. Do not speak
   evil of anyone, refrain from causing any loss of value.

  <h2>Every Thing Is Sacred</h2>
  <p>To be Christian is to see Christ in every thing. The book "The Universal Christ" by Richard Rohr reminds us that
   the spirit of Christ is alive in all living flesh.</p>
  <blockquote>
   I saw ... the reverence that everyone must have for a sinner; instead of condoning [their] sin, which in reality
   is
   [their] utmost sorrow, one must comfort Christ who is suffering in [them]. And this reverence must be paid even to
   the those sinners whose souls seem to be dead, because it is Christ, who is the life of the soul, who is dead in
   them; they are His tombs, and Christ in the tomb [has the potential to become] the risen Christ. . . . Christ is
   everywhere; in Him every kind of life has a meaning and has an influence on every other kind of life.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Physical touch between men is body-knowledge and communicates the Spirit of Christ with clarity and certainty
  </h2>
  <p>Men of the United States, I implore you to wake up to the universal spirit of brotherhood through non-sexual
   physical touch. If a man will not touch another man, he
   is in spiritual bankruptcy.</p>
  <p>1 Thessalonians 5:26 states "Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss". If Christian men are not willing to
   transmit Gnosis (body-knowing of the Christ spirit) with a holy kiss, Jesus cannot find root within our culture. Men,
   wake up and kiss your friends, family, and community members in a holy and sensitive manner. Face to face contact is
   essential for transmitting the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p>In addition to kissing, all manner of gentle and sensitive touch informs the Holy Spirit. If you do not know how to
   touch other men for purpose of communicating the spirit of Christ, start with a light
   hand-to-hand touch and then push against each others shoulders and chests gently yet firmly (this isn't a sports
   match). This awakens the correct 'Gnostic' spirit of
   Christ in male-bodied individuals. If the touch offered is of the Holy Spirit, it is immediately recognized and
   welcomed warmly by the recipient.</p>
  <p>In order to achieve our highest potential as a human species, men should not sexually interact with women, except
   in the container of a committed Christ-centered
   relationship for the purpose of creating new human life.</p>
 </a>
 <a>
  <h2>Women, re-awaken yourselves to the truth of your healing powers</h2>

  <h2>Apply no violence and beware of shedding blood</h2>
  <blockquote>The human body and the soul, which is from God and lives in the human body, are the house of God, the
   temple of the
   Holy Spirit. Deep in the soul is God's love, wisdom, and justice. Thus, God dwells in the soul. Accordingly, the
   soul
   and body of the human being are the temple of God. And so, the one who breaks into the house of flesh and bone, by
   doing violence to people, by subjugating them, by treating them as slaves, or even killing them, sins against the
   Holy Spirit. ... So keep your hands pure and your soul pure, not just from theft and robbery. But above all, do
   not
   use violence, be it on people on animals, and beware of shedding their blood.</blockquote>
