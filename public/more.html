  <h2>Every Thing Is Sacred</h2>
  <p>To be Christian is to see Christ in every thing. The book "The Universal Christ" by Richard Rohr reminds us that
   the spirit of Christ is alive in all living flesh.</p>
  <blockquote>
   I saw ... the reverence that everyone must have for a sinner; instead of condoning [their] sin, which in reality
   is
   [their] utmost sorrow, one must comfort Christ who is suffering in [them]. And this reverence must be paid even to
   the those sinners whose souls seem to be dead, because it is Christ, who is the life of the soul, who is dead in
   them; they are His tombs, and Christ in the tomb [has the potential to become] the risen Christ. . . . Christ is
   everywhere; in Him every kind of life has a meaning and has an influence on every other kind of life.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Physical touch between men is body-knowledge and communicates the Spirit of Christ with clarity and certainty
  </h2>
  <p>Men of the United States, I implore you to wake up to the universal spirit of brotherhood through non-sexual
   physical touch. If a man will not touch another man, he
   is in spiritual bankruptcy.</p>
  <p>1 Thessalonians 5:26 states "Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss". If Christian men are not willing to
   transmit Gnosis (body-knowing of the Christ spirit) with a holy kiss, Jesus cannot find root within our culture.
   Men,
   wake up and kiss your friends, family, and community members in a holy and sensitive manner. Face to face contact is
   essential for transmitting the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p>In addition to kissing, all manner of gentle and sensitive touch informs the Holy Spirit. If you do not know how
   to
   touch other men for purpose of communicating the spirit of Christ, start with a light
   hand-to-hand touch and then push against each others shoulders and chests gently yet firmly (this isn't a sports
   match). This awakens the correct 'Gnostic' spirit of
   Christ in male-bodied individuals. If the touch offered is of the Holy Spirit, it is immediately recognized and
   welcomed warmly by the recipient.</p>
  <p>In order to achieve our highest potential as a human species, men should not sexually interact with women, except
   in the container of a committed Christ-centered
   relationship for the purpose of creating new human life.</p>

  <h2>Apply no violence and beware of shedding blood</h2>
  <blockquote>The human body and the soul, which is from God and lives in the human body, are the house of God, the
   temple of the
   Holy Spirit. Deep in the soul is God's love, wisdom, and justice. Thus, God dwells in the soul. Accordingly, the
   soul
   and body of the human being are the temple of God. And so, the one who breaks into the house of flesh and bone, by
   doing violence to people, by subjugating them, by treating them as slaves, or even killing them, sins against the
   Holy Spirit. ... So keep your hands pure and your soul pure, not just from theft and robbery. But above all, do
   not
   use violence, be it on people on animals, and beware of shedding their blood.</blockquote>

  <h2>End Circumcision Now</h2>
  <p>Circumcision (male genital mutilation) destroys living human cells, nerves, and decreases the sensitivity of the
   male to his own energy, leading to social dysfunction. Female genital mutilation is an equally grave evil.</p>
